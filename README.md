# CSCE 355 Project
### Creating, Simulating, Modifying DFA's

*The following copied from Dr. Fenner's original project specifications.*

For the programming portion of the course (10% of my grade) I am to write programs that perform two or more of a choice of six tasks involving DFAs. I may choose to implement two or more of the following functions:

I am only required to implement two of the six tasks below (my choice) -- any additional functionality will earn me extra credit ("1% of my final grade per additional task correctly implemented").

#### (1) Simulate a DFA

After reading the description of a DFA *N* from a text file, read any number of strings over *N*'s alphabet from another text file, indicating (to `stdout`) whether *N* accepts or rejects each of the strings.

*Status*: **Implemented**

##### (2) Minimizing a DFA
##### (3) Text Search
##### (4) Complement and Intersection
##### (5) Inverse Homomorphic Image
##### (6) Determining Properties of a DFA
